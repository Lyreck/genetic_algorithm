# genetic_algorithm
Implementation of the genetic algorithm meta-heuristic for a specific industrial engineering optimization use case.

The objective of this project was to allocate machines to pre-determined spots, given a set of products that needed to visit the machines in a specific order, in order to maximize a factory's output. I did this while at Mines Nancy, in my industrial engineering class.

This code will not run by itself, it needs data that was provided with the course I was following at the time, and is not mine to share.
